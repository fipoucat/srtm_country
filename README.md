# srtm_country
Download SRTM for an entire country with R {raster}

This short script helps you with the download of the SRTM 90m resolution (3 arc-seconds) for an entire country using R {raster}.

First, download the srtm subfolder which includes the SRTM tile grid. 

Second, specify the ISO Country code (i.e. "AUT" for Austria) and the script automatically downloads all tiles for the defined country and mosaics them together.
